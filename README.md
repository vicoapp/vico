# Vico

Vico is a programmers text editor with a strong focus on keyboard
control. Vico uses vi key bindings to let you keep your fingers on the
home row and work effectively with your text.

Vico comes with support for the most common languages, such as html,
php, ruby and javascript. And since Vico can use existing TextMate
bundles, it's easy to add more.

Vico also features integrated SFTP for working with remote files, split
views to let you edit files side-by-side and a file explorer for fast
project navigation.

Quickly navigate between files using fuzzy find, or open files directly
from the ex command line with tab completion. Jumping to symbols is easy
with the symbol list, or use ctags to find the definition under the
cursor. Ctags even works remotely over SFTP.


## Building

Vico uses `make` to build. Simply type

	make run

to build and launch. While there is an xcode project, it is not up to
date and will not build properly.
